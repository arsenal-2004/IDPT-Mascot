# IDPT-Mascot
Robotic arm project for interdepartmental competition

The robotic arm acts as a segregator for differentiating between black and white objects moving on a conveyor belt. Accordingly, the objects are placed in separate bins.

Arduino Uno is used, along with ultrasound and infrared sensors for stopping the conveyor belt and detecting the colour of the object respectively. We used Servo motors for the movement of the robotic arm, and DC motors for the movement of the conveyor belt. 

I have uploaded images of the final robot, as well as the Arduino code required for its movement.
